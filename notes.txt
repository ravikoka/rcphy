typically dont want to call determinant in code. determinant is product of eigenvalues. 

if one is zero, numerically might be small like 1e-12. But if large matrix, with some large eigenvalues, could easily calculate a determinant of 1000, when it shouldve been 0. 

So instead get eigenvalues, check if any below some threshold. 

For similar reasons, dont take log of determinant or log of product of eigenvals. Find eigenvals and take sum of logs.
